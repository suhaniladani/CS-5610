Design choices:

-The following design choices have been made:
-Followed many to many relationship for the manager and employee.
-One managers manage many employees and one employee could be managed by many managers.
-Added the button to go to the tasklist page
-When the show user button(for his own profile) is pressed by the person who has logged in, it shows the list of employees that he manages.
-The task feed shows the tasks of the user who is currently logged in, i.e. it only shows his/her own tasks.
